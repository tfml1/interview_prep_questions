100 React js
Interview Q&A
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is React.js?
React.js is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user
interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components
and efficiently update and render them as the application state
changes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the key features of React.js?
React.js has several key features, including:
Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to
efficiently update and render components.
Component-based architecture: React follows a modular
approach, where UIs are built using reusable components.
Unidirectional data flow: React follows a one-way data binding,
making it easier to track and debug data changes.
JSX: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows developers to
write HTML-like code within JavaScript.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React.js. It allows
developers to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript,
making it easier to create and manipulate React elements.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain the difference between functional components and class
components in React.
Functional components are stateless and are defined as JavaScript
functions. They are simpler and easier to read, test, and maintain.
Class components, on the other hand, are defined as ES6 classes and
have additional management features like lifecycle methods and state

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of the "render" method in React?
The "render" method is a required method in every React
component. It returns a description of what the component should
render. The render method is responsible for rendering the
component's JSX or other React components.

In React, the render() method is used to return the JSX for a component.
With class components, the render() method is automatically called when a component is mounted and its returned value is used to render the component.
With functional components, you don't have a render() method, instead, you directly return a JSX expression. Functional components are usually used for simple components where the logic is not complex and the component doesn't need to manage its own state or lifecycle.
In both cases, the returned JSX is used to create the actual HTML that is rendered to the screen

The render() method in React is a built-in method that is required for all components. It's responsible for rendering the component to the UI. The render() method returns HTML (written in JSX syntax), which will be displayed in the browser.
In Class components, the render() method is used like this:

class MyApp extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

In this case, render() is part of the class definition, and it's automatically called by React when it needs to render or re-render the component.

In Functional components, there is no render() method. Instead, the entire component is a function that returns what should be rendered:

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

In this case, the function itself acts like the render() method.
In both cases, the result is the same: the component outputs a <div> with a <h1> element inside it. The difference is mostly the syntax and how you structure your component.
In recent versions of React, functional components are more commonly used because they are easier to read and test, and they work well with React's newer features like hooks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a React element?
A React element is a lightweight representation of a DOM element. It
is a plain JavaScript object that describes what should be rendered
on the screen. React elements are the building blocks of React
applications.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
What is a React component?
A React component is a reusable and self-contained module that
represents a part of the user interface. It can be a function
component or a class component. Components encapsulate logic
and UI, making it easier to develop and maintain complex
applications.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is state in React?
State is an object that holds data that can change over time in a
React component. It represents the mutable part of the component
and can be accessed using this.state. When the state changes, React
re-renders the component to reflect the updated data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between props and state in React?
Props (short for properties) and state are both used to manage data
in React components, but they have some differences:
Props are read-only and are passed from parent components to
child components. They are used to pass data down the
component tree.
State is mutable and is managed internally within a component.
It is used to manage data that can change over time within a
component.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of keys in React lists?
Keys are used to give a unique identity to each element in a list
rendered by React. They help React identify which items have
changed, been added, or been removed. Keys improve the efficiency
of list rendering and help maintain component state correctly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain the concept of the virtual DOM in React.
The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM maintained
by React. It is a representation of the UI components and their
structure. When there are changes in the application state, React
compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM and efficiently updates
only the necessary parts, resulting in better performance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are React hooks?
React hooks are functions that allow functional components to use
state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks, such as
useState and useEffect, provide a simpler way to manage
component state and lifecycle.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the useEffect hook?
The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in a React
component. It allows you to perform actions like data fetching,
subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM after the component
has rendered.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the role of the useState hook?
The useState hook is used to add state to functional components. It
returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a
function to update that value. It enables functional components to
have state similar to class components.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are controlled components in React?

Controlled components are React components that manage their
state using the state property and update it using setState(). They
receive their current value and change callbacks as props, and they
notify parent components of state changes through these callbacks.

React allows us to control whether a component is controlled or uncontrolled through the use of state and props. Here is a simple example:

Controlled Component:

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledInput() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setName(event.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <input 
      type="text" 
      value={name}
      onChange={handleChange} 
    />
  );
}

Here the input value is controlled by the component state. We update the state on every change and the input displays the state value.

Uncontrolled Component:

import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    const value = inputRef.current.value;
    console.log(value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </>
  );
}

Here the input value is not controlled. We access it directly from the DOM node when needed.

The key difference is a controlled component's value is tied to state, while an uncontrolled component's value is accessed directly from the DOM


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the useCallback hook?
The useCallback hook is used to memoize functions in React. It
returns a memoized version of the callback function that only
changes if one of the dependencies has changed. It helps optimize
performance by avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of components.


usememo n usecallback difference
While both useMemo and useCallback are used for performance optimization in React, they are used in different scenarios:
    useMemo is used to memoize values. It returns a memoized value.

const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
  // Perform expensive calculations here.
  // This code will only run if `dependencies` change.
}, dependencies);

Here useMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render.
    useCallback, on the other hand, is used to memoize functions. It returns a memoized function.

const memoizedFunction = useCallback(() => {
  // Your function here.
  // This function will only be re-created if `dependencies` change.
}, dependencies);

Here useCallback will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.
In short, if you want to prevent a value from being recalculated or a function from being recreated at each render, unless its dependencies have changed, you would use useMemo and useCallback respectively
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain the concept of prop drilling in React.
Prop drilling refers to the process of passing props through multiple
layers of components in order to reach a deeply nested component
that needs access to the data. It can make the code more complex
and lead to less maintainable code. Context API or Redux can be
used to avoid prop drilling.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the Context API in React?
The Context API is a built-in feature of React that provides a way to
share data between components without explicitly passing it
through props. It allows you to create a global state accessible to any
component within a designated context.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of React Router?
React Router is a popular library used for implementing routing in
React applications. It allows developers to handle navigation and
rendering of different components based on the URL. React Router
provides a declarative way to define routes and nested routes in the
application.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Redux?
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It
provides a centralized store to manage the state of an application
and follows a unidirectional data flow. Redux is commonly used with
React to manage the application's global state.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain the concept of "pure components" in React.
Pure components are React components that implement a
shouldComponentUpdate method with a shallow prop and state
comparison. They only re-render when the data they receive or hold
has changed. Pure components optimize rendering performance by
preventing unnecessary re-rendering.

Pure components in React are components that implement the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method to do a shallow comparison of props and state and determine if the component needs to re-render or not.
The key things to know about pure components:
    They should only re-render if props or state change. This prevents unnecessary re-renders when props/state are the same.
    shouldComponentUpdate performs a shallow comparison of the current and next props/state using Object.is.
    This means it will only detect changes to top-level props/state values, not changes to nested/complex objects or arrays.
    Components that render frequently or have complex props are good candidates for using pure components to optimize performance.
    You can write your own pure component by implementing shouldComponentUpdate, or use React.PureComponent which implements a default shouldComponentUpdate with shallow comparisons.
So in summary, pure components help optimize re-renders by preventing unnecessary re-renders when props/state are shallow-equal, helping improve performance of components that render frequently. The key is they only do shallow comparisons, so aren't suitable if you have nested/complex prop/state values.

In React, a "pure component" is a component that has no side effects and always returns the same output given the same props. In other words, a pure component is a function that takes props as input and returns a React element without modifying any external state or causing any side effects.
The concept of pure components is useful for several reasons:
    Easier testing: Pure components are easier to test because their behavior is predictable and doesn't depend on external state. You can test a pure component by passing it different props and verifying that it returns the expected element.
    Better performance: Pure components are faster because React can cache their output and reuse it when the component is re-rendered with the same props. This can reduce the number of re-renders and improve performance.
    Simpler debugging: Pure components are easier to debug because their behavior is predictable and doesn't depend on external state. You can trace the output of a pure component more easily and identify issues.

To make a component pure, you can follow these guidelines:
    Avoid using state or context: Pure components should not use state or context. Instead, they should take all the props they need and return a React element.
    Avoid side effects: Pure components should not have any side effects, such as making API calls or modifying external state. They should only render UI based on their props.
    Use a pure function: A pure component should be a pure function, meaning that it should have no side effects and should always return the same output given the same props.
    Use the shouldComponentUpdate() method: You can use the shouldComponentUpdate() method to define a pure component. This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the component should update or not. If the method returns false, the component will not update when its props change.

Here's an example of a pure component:

function Person(props) {
  return <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;
}

function PersonWithName(props) {
  return <Person name={props.name} />;
}

In this example, the Person component is a pure component because it takes a name prop and returns a React element without any side effects.
 The PersonWithName component is also a pure component


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of the React Developer Tools extension?
The React Developer Tools extension is a browser extension that
allows developers to inspect and debug React components. It
provides a panel that displays the component hierarchy, props, state,
and other useful information for React applications.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you optimize the performance of a React application?
To optimize the performance of a React application, you can:
Use shouldComponentUpdate
unnecessary re-rendering. or PureComponent to prevent
Implement code splitting and lazy loading to load components only
when needed.
Use memoization techniques such as useMemo and useCallback to
avoid expensive computations or unnecessary re-renders.
Implement server-side rendering (SSR) to improve the initial load
time and SEO.
Optimize the size of the bundled JavaScript and CSS files using
techniques like minification and compression.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the different lifecycle methods in React?
React has several lifecycle methods, including:
componentDidMount: Called after the component has been
mounted to the DOM.
componentDidUpdate: Called after the component has been
updated and re-rendered.
componentWillUnmount: Called just before the component is
unmounted and destroyed.
shouldComponentUpdate: Allows optimization by determining
whether the component should re-render or not.
render: Renders the component's JSX or other React components.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of the "key" prop in React?
The "key" prop is used to give a unique identity to elements in an
array rendered by React. It helps React optimize the rendering
process by efficiently updating and reordering the elements when
necessary.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" attribute in
React?
The "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" attribute is used to insert HTML
content directly into a component. It should be used with caution as
it poses a security risk if not used properly.

dangerouslySetInnerHTML is a way to set HTML content as the innerHTML of a React component directly from a string. It is considered dangerous because it opens your app up to XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks.
Here is an example of how to use dangerouslySetInnerHTML:

import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const htmlString = '<h1>Hello World!</h1>';

  return (
    <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: htmlString}} />
  );
}
export default MyComponent;

Breakdown:
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML expects an object with a property called __html
    This __html property contains the HTML string to render
    React will insert this raw HTML directly into the DOM as innerHTML
Some key points:
    Only use for trusted HTML content, never user input
    Bypasses React's sanitization and XSS protection
    Consider alternative approaches like rendering JSX if possible
    Useful for rendering HTML snippets from 3rd party APIs
So in summary, dangerouslySetInnerHTML allows setting raw HTML content directly in the DOM as innerHTML from a string. But it opens security risks, so should only be used for trusted content like snippets from APIs. Consider alternatives like JSX rendering when possible

import React from 'react';
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: '<p>This is some sample text</p>' }} />
    );
  }
}
In this example, the dangerouslySetInnerHTML property is set to the string <p>This is some sample text</p>. This string contains HTML content that will be displayed within the component.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you prevent a component from rendering in React?
You can prevent a component from rendering by returning null or
false from its render method. Alternatively, you can use lifecycle
methods like shouldComponentUpdate or React.memo to control
the re-rendering process.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of the "children" prop in React?
The "children" prop is a special prop in React that allows
components to display whatever is included between their opening
and closing tags. It can be used to pass JSX elements or plain text as
children to a component.
The children prop in React allows components to pass JSX elements directly to another component as a "prop". This is useful for composing UI by nesting components inside one another.
For example:

function WelcomeDialog() {
  return (
    <Dialog>
      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>Thank you for visiting our site!</p>
    </Dialog>
  );
}
---
function Dialog({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="dialog">
      <h2>Dialog Box</h2>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

Here:
    WelcomeDialog nests JSX elements inside Dialog
    Dialog uses {children} to render anything passed to it
    children acts as a placeholder for nested content
Benefits of children:
    Allows building UI by composing components
    Parent can render any nested JSX elements
    Children don't need to be known ahead of time
    Dialog is reusable with any children
So in summary, the children prop allows components to act as placeholders for nested JSX passed from parent components. This enables UI composition by nesting reusable child components within others.

In React, the children prop is a special prop that allows you to pass child components to a parent component. The children prop is significant because it enables you to create modular, reusable components that can be easily combined to build complex user interfaces.
Here are some key aspects of the children prop:
    Children can be any type of component: You can pass any valid React component as a child to another component. This means you can nest any type of component within another component, allowing you to create complex, hierarchical structures.
    Children are optional: You can choose to not pass any children to a component. In this case, the component will not render anything by default.
    Children are not rendered by default: Unlike other props, children are not rendered by default. You need to explicitly render the children using the render method or a return statement.
    Children can be accessed using the props.children property: Once you have passed children to a component, you can access them using the props.children property. This allows you to manipulate or render the children in a predictable way.
Here's an example of using the children prop to pass a child component to a parent component:

import React from 'react';

const ParentComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render the children */}
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
};

const ChildComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

const app = () => {
  return (
    <ParentComponent>
      <ChildComponent />
    </ParentComponent>
  );
};
export default app;

In this example, we define a ParentComponent that accepts a children prop. We then pass a ChildComponent as a child to the ParentComponent. The ChildComponent renders an heading with the text "Hello World!".
When we render the app component, the ParentComponent will render the ChildComponent as its child, and the heading will be displayed in the user interface.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How can you update the state of a component in React?

To update the state of a component, you should never mutate the
state directly. Instead, use the setState method provided by React. It
accepts a new state object or a function that returns a new state
object, and React will merge the changes and trigger a re-render.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "defaultProps" property in React?
The "defaultProps" property is used to define default values for props
in a React component. If a prop is not provided when the
component is used, the default value specified in defaultProps will
be used instead.
--------------------------------------
In functional components, you can use usedefaultProps hook to provide default values for props that React provides for this purpose.
Here's an example of how you can use defaultProps in a functional component:

import React, { useDefaultProps} from 'react';

const MyComponent = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  const { prop1: prop1Default, prop2: prop2Default } = useDefaultProps(
    {
      prop1: 'Default value 1',
      prop2: 'Default value 2',
    }
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Component</h1>
      <p>Prop1: {prop1Default}</p>
      <p>Prop2: {prop2Default}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;

In the example above, the useDefaultProps hook is used to access the default values for prop1 and prop2. The useDefaultProps hook takes an options object with default values for props as its second argument.
You can use the MyComponent component like this:

<MyComponent prop1="Custom value 1" prop2="Custom value 2" />
The prop1 and prop2 values in the MyComponent component's props object will be Custom value 1 and Custom value 2, respectively. However, if you pass these props without providing a value, the default values defined in defaultProps will be used instead:
<MyComponent />
In this case, prop1 and prop2 in the MyComponent component's props object will be Default value 1 and Default value 2, respectively.
---------------------------------

another way for default prop-->>
(create an object and pass it)
Let's say we're building a simple Button component that displays a message when clicked. We want to set some default properties for the button, such as the text and the color, so that we can use the same component in different parts of our app with consistent behavior.
Here's an example of how we might define our Button component using default props:

import React from 'react';

const Button = ({ text = 'Click me!', color = 'blue' }) => {
  return (
    <button style={{ backgroundColor: color, color: color, padding: '10px', borderRadius: '5px' }}>
      {text}
    </button>
  );
};

export default Button;

In this example, we define the Button component as a function that takes an object of properties as its only argument. We use the = operator to assign default values to the text and color properties, so that if a user doesn't provide values for these properties, the component will still display a button with the default text and color.
Now, let's say we want to use the Button component in another part of our app, and we want to change the text and color. We can pass in our own values for these properties, like this:

import React from 'react';
import Button from './Button';

const MyButton = () => {
  return (
    <Button text="Click me twice!" color="red" />
  );
};
In this example, we're using the Button component and passing in our own values for the text and color properties. However, because we didn't provide any values for these properties in our Button component's default props, the component will still display a button with the default text and color.
This way, we can easily set default properties for our components and ensure that they have consistent behavior across our app.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is React Fiber?
React Fiber is a reimplementation of React's core algorithm for
rendering and updating components. It was introduced to improve
performance, enable incremental rendering, and better support
concurrent mode. (more in prepnotes.txt)
React Fiber is a new rendering algorithm and architecture for React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was introduced in React 16.8 and is designed to improve the performance and stability of React applications, especially those with complex and dynamic UI layouts.
React Fiber is based on the concept of "fibers," which are lightweight, composable units of work that represent the rendering of a component or a sub-component. Fibers are optimized for batching and prioritization, allowing React to handle a large number of updates and rendering operations efficiently.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain the concept of "render props" in React.
Render props is a technique in React where a component accepts a
function as a prop and uses it to render content. This allows the
component to share its internal state and logic with the function
component passed as a prop, enabling code reuse and
composability. (more in prepnotes.txt)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "key" prop in a list of React
components?
The "key" prop is used to provide a unique identifier for each item in
a list of React components. It helps React identify which items have
changed, been added, or been removed, improving the efficiency of
list rendering and component updates.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are portals in React?
Portals in React provide a way to render children components into a
different DOM node that exists outside the parent component's
hierarchy. It allows you to render components at a different position
in the DOM tree, which can be useful for modals, tooltips, and
overlays. (more in prepnotes.txt)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of the "dangerouslySetState" method in
React?
The "dangerouslySetState" method is used to update the state of a
React component. It is called directly on the component instance
and bypasses the usual state update mechanism provided by
setState. The use of "dangerouslySetState" is discouraged and should
be avoided in most cases.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain the concept of code splitting in React.
Code splitting is a technique used to split a React application's
JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks. It allows you to load only the
required code when needed, improving the initial load time and
reducing the overall bundle size. React.lazy and React.Suspense are
commonly used for code splitting.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "Fragment" component in React?
The "Fragment" component is a built-in component in React that
allows you to group multiple elements together without adding an
extra DOM node. It is useful when you need to return multiple
elements from a component's render method without wrapping
them in a parent element. (rest in prepnotes.txt)
react-router-dom with React.lazy() and React.loadable() can be used for reducing the initial loading time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you handle forms in React?
In React, form handling typically involves capturing user input,
managing it with component state, and handling form submission.
You can use controlled components, where form elements are linked
to the component state, or use libraries like Formik or React Hook
Form for advanced form handling.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are React refs?
Refs in React are a way to access and interact with DOM elements or
React components directly. They provide a way to reference and
manipulate DOM elements outside the usual React component
hierarchy. Refs should be used sparingly and primarily for interacting
with non-React libraries or imperative DOM operations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "componentWillUnmount" method in
React?
The componentWillUnmount method is a lifecycle method in React
that is called just before a component is unmounted and destroyed.
It provides an opportunity to perform cleanup tasks such as
canceling network requests, removing event listeners, or clearing
timers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain the concept of error boundaries in React.
Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors
in their child component tree and display fallback UI instead of
crashing the whole application. They help isolate errors and provide
a better user experience by gracefully handling errors at the
component level. (prepnotes.txt)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "React.StrictMode" component?
The React.StrictMode component is a wrapper component provided
by React. When used, it enables additional warnings and checks
during development. It helps highlight potential problems and
deprecated features in the application code. (prepnotes.txt)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of the "setState" method in React?
The setState method is used to update the state of a React
component. It accepts a new state object or a function that returns a
new state object. React will merge the changes and trigger a rerender of the component and its children.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "shouldComponentUpdate" method in
React?
The shouldComponentUpdate method is a lifecycle method that
allows you to optimize performance by determining whether a
component should re-render or not. It is called before rendering and
can be used to compare previous and new props or state to decide
whether an update is necessary. (repeated)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the role of the "React.Fragment" component in React?
The React.Fragment component allows you to return multiple
elements from a component's render method without adding an
extra DOM node. It is useful when you don't want to introduce an
additional wrapper element in the rendered output. (repeated)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "getDerivedStateFromProps" method in
React?
The getDerivedStateFromProps is a static lifecycle method that is
called before rendering when new props are received. It allows you
to update the component's state based on the changes in the
incoming props. It is rarely needed and can often be replaced with
other patterns like componentDidUpdate or useState.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain the concept of higher-order components (HOCs) in React.
Higher-order components are functions that take a component as
input and return an enhanced version of that component. HOCs are
used for code reuse, cross-cutting concerns, and augmenting
components with additional functionality. They are a powerful
pattern for component composition in React.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "React.memo" function in React?
The React.memo function is a higher-order component (HOC) that
memoizes a functional component. It helps optimize performance
by preventing unnecessary re-renders of the component when its
props haven't changed. It is similar to PureComponent for class
components. (repeated)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between an element and a component in
React?
In React, an element is a plain JavaScript object that represents a
single instance of a DOM element or a React component. It is the
smallest building block in React. A component, on the other hand, is
a reusable and self-contained module that encapsulates logic and
UI. Components can be either function components or class
components.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "React.createRef" method in React?
The React.createRef method is used to create a ref object in React.
Refs are a way to access and interact with DOM elements or React
components directly. They provide a way to reference and
manipulate elements outside the usual React component hierarchy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you conditionally render components in React?
Conditional rendering in React can be achieved using various
techniques, such as:
Using if statements or ternary operators in the component's render
method.
Using logical && operator to conditionally render an element.
Using the map method to render a list of components conditionally.
Using conditional rendering libraries like react-router or reactloadable for more complex scenarios.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "React.cloneElement" method in React?
The React.cloneElement method is used to clone and modify a React
element with new props. It allows you to pass additional props to a
child component created by another component. It is often used in
cases where you need to enhance or modify the behavior of a child
component.(notes)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of the "React.PureComponent" class in
React? (repeated)
The React.PureComponent class is a base class in React that provides
a convenient way to optimize performance for class components. It
implements a shallow prop and state comparison in the
shouldComponentUpdate method, automatically preventing unnecessary re-renders when the data hasn't changed.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How can you pass data between components in React?
Data can be passed between components in React through props.
Parent components can pass data to child components by setting
props on the child component elements. In more complex scenarios,
you can use techniques like context API, Redux, or libraries like React
Router to share data across components.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "React.Children" utility in React?
The React.Children utility provides a set of methods for working with
the props.children property of a React component. It allows you to
iterate, map, and count the children of a component, regardless of
whether they are single elements or arrays of elements. (notes)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain the concept of "uncontrolled components" in React. (repeated)
Uncontrolled components are form elements in React that store
their own state internally, rather than being controlled by React's
component state. They allow user input to be directly accessed
through the DOM, which can be useful in some scenarios but can
make it harder to enforce constraints or validation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "React.createContext" method in React?
The React.createContext method is used to create a new context
object in React. Context provides a way to share data between
components without having to pass it explicitly through props. It is
especially useful when data needs to be accessed by multiple
components at different levels of the component tree.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you handle events in React?
In React, you can handle events by providing event handlers as props
to elements. Event handlers are functions that are executed when a
specific event occurs, such as a button click or a form submission.
React uses synthetic events that wrap the native browser events and
provide consistent behavior across different browsers.
import React from 'react';
const Buttoneventtest = (props) => {
  const handleClick = () => { console.log('Button clicked!') }
  return ( <button onClick={handleClick}> Click Me </button> )}
export default Buttoneventtest;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What is the purpose of the "React.createPortal" method in React?
The React.createPortal method is used to render a React
component's content into a different DOM node, which can be
outside the parent component's hierarchy. It is commonly used to
render modal dialogs, tooltips, or overlays that need to be rendered
at a different position in the DOM tree. (repeated)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the role of the "componentDidCatch" method in React?
The componentDidCatch method is a lifecycle method in React that
is called when an error occurs within a component's child tree. It
allows the component to catch the error and handle it gracefully by
displaying an error boundary or a fallback UI. (notes)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain the concept of lazy loading in React.
Lazy loading is a code splitting technique used to load components or assets only
when they are needed, rather than loading everything upfront.
React.lazy and Suspense are used to implement lazy loading in
React. Lazy loading can significantly improve the initial load time
and performance of an application. (repeated/notes)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "React.Suspense" component in React?
The React.Suspense component is a built-in component in React
that enables handling of loading states and code splitting. It is used
in combination with React.lazy to specify a fallback UI or loading
indicator while waiting for a component to load asynchronously.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of the "React.memo" function in React?
The React.memo function is a higher-order component (HOC) that
memoizes a functional component. It helps optimize performance
by preventing unnecessary re-renders of the component when its
props haven't changed. It is similar to PureComponent for class
components. (repeated)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you prevent a component from re-rendering in React? (repeated)
To prevent a component from re-rendering, you can use techniques
Using PureComponent or React.memo to optimize performance and
prevent re-rendering when the props haven't changed.
Implementing the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method and
returning false when no updates are needed.
Using state management libraries like Redux or MobX to manage
the component's state outside the component hierarchy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "React.Fragment" component in React?
The React.Fragment component allows you to group multiple
elements together without adding an extra DOM node. It is useful
when you need to return multiple elements from a component's
render method without wrapping them in a parent element. (repeated)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain the concept of error boundaries in React.
Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors
in their child component tree and display fallback UI instead of
crashing the whole application. They help isolate errors and provide
a better user experience by gracefully handling errors at the
component level. (repeated)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "useEffect" hook in React?
The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in a functional component.
It is similar to componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined. 
It allows you to perform actions like data fetching, subscriptions, or
manually changing the DOM after the component has rendered. (repeated)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between useState and useReducer hooks in React?
useState is a hook used to manage state in functional components,
providing a way to add local state to a component. useReducer, on
the other hand, is a hook that provides a more powerful state
management solution for complex state logic. It is based on the
concept of a reducer function and actions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "useContext" hook in React? (repeated)
The useContext hook is used to consume values from a context in
functional components. It allows you to access the current context
value directly without wrapping the component in a context
consumer. It simplifies the process of accessing shared data across
components.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "useCallback" hook in React? (repeated)
The useCallback hook is used to memoize functions in React. It
returns a memoized version of the callback function that only
changes if one of the dependencies has changed. It helps optimize
performance by avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of components.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you handle forms in React? (repeated)
In React, form handling typically involves capturing user input,
managing it with component state, and handling form submission.
You can use controlled components, where form elements are linked
to the component state, or use libraries like Formik or React Hook
Form for advanced form handling.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "useState" hook in React? (repeated)
The useState hook is used to add state to functional components. It
returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a
function to update that value. It enables functional components to
have state similar to class components.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of the "key" prop in React lists? (repeated)
The "key" prop is used to give a unique identity to each element in a
list rendered by React. It helps React identify which items have
changed, been added, or been removed. Keys improve the efficiency
of list rendering and help maintain component state correctly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are hooks in React? (repeated)
Hooks are functions that allow functional components to use state
and other React features without writing a class. They were
introduced in React 16.8 and provide a simpler and more flexible way
to manage component state and lifecycle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "React.memo" function in React? (repeated)
The React.memo function is a higher-order component (HOC) that
memoizes a functional component. It helps optimize performance
by preventing unnecessary re-renders of the component when its
props haven't changed. It is similar to PureComponent for class
components.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you handle events in React? (repeated)
In React, you can handle events by providing event handlers as props
to elements. Event handlers are functions that are executed when a
specific event occurs, such as a button click or a form submission.
React uses synthetic events that wrap the native browser events and
provide consistent behavior across different browsers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of the "dangerouslySetInnerHTML"
attribute in React?  (repeated)
The "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" attribute is used to insert HTML
content directly into a component. It should be used with caution as
it poses a security risk if not used properly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "defaultProps" property in React?
The "defaultProps" property is used to define default values for props
in a React component. If a prop is not provided when the
component is used, the default value specified in defaultProps will
be used instead. (repeated)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "componentDidMount" method in
React? (repeated)
The componentDidMount method is a lifecycle method in React that
is called after the component has been mounted to the DOM. It is
commonly used to initiate network requests, set up subscriptions, or
perform other initialization tasks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the role of the "componentDidUpdate" method in React?
The componentDidUpdate method is a lifecycle method in React
that is called after a component has been updated and re-rendered.
It is often used to perform side effects based on changes in props or
state, such as making additional network requests or updating the
DOM. (repeated)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "componentWillUnmount" method in
React? (repeated)
The componentWillUnmount method is a lifecycle method in React
that is called just before a component is unmounted and destroyed.
It provides an opportunity to perform cleanup tasks such as
canceling network requests, removing event listeners, or clearing
timers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between a controlled component and an
uncontrolled component in React? (repeated)
A controlled component is a component whose state is controlled by
React. It receives its current value and change callbacks as props and
notifies parent components of state changes through these
callbacks. An uncontrolled component, on the other hand, stores its
own state internally and manages it through the DOM, without
involving React's component state.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "render" method in React? (repeated)
The "render" method is a required method in every React
component. It returns a description of what the component should
render. The render method is responsible for rendering the
component's JSX or other React components.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of the "children" prop in React? (repeated)
The "children" prop is a special prop in React that allows
components to display whatever is included between their opening
and closing tags. It can be used to pass JSX elements or plain text as
children to a component.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you update the state of a component in React? (repeated)
To update the state of a component, you should never mutate the
state directly. Instead, use the setState method provided by React. It
accepts a new state object or a function that returns a new state
object, and React will merge the changes and trigger a re-render.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "shouldComponentUpdate" method in
React? (repeated)
The shouldComponentUpdate method is a lifecycle method that
allows you to optimize performance by determining whether a
component should re-render or not. It is called before rendering and
can be used to compare previous and new props or state to decide
whether an update is necessary.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the difference between props and state in React? (repeated)
Props (short for properties) and state are both used to manage data
in React components, but they have some differences:
Props are read-only and are passed from parent components to child
components. They are used to pass data down the component tree.
State is mutable and is managed internally within a component. It is
used to manage data that can change over time within a
component.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the significance of the virtual DOM in React? (repeated)
The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM maintained
by React. It is a representation of the UI components and their
structure. When there are changes in the application state, React
compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM and efficiently updates
only the necessary parts, resulting in better performance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is JSX in React? (repeated)
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React. It allows
developers to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript,
making it easier to create and manipulate React elements.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are React fragments? (repeated)
React fragments allow you to group multiple elements together
without adding an extra DOM node. They provide a way to return
multiple elements from a component's render method without
wrapping them in a parent element.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the Context API in React? (repeated)
The Context API is a built-in feature of React that provides a way to
share data between components without explicitly passing it
through props. It allows you to create a global state accessible to any
component within a designated context.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of React Router in React applications? (repeated)
React Router is a popular library used for implementing routing in
React applications. It allows developers to handle navigation and
rendering of different components based on the URL. React Router
provides a declarative way to define routes and nested routes in the
application.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Redux and how does it relate to React? (repeated)
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It
provides a centralized store to manage the state of an application
and follows a unidirectional data flow. Redux is commonly used with
React to manage the application's global state.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you optimize the performance of a React application? (repeated)
To optimize the performance of a React application, you can:
Use shouldComponentUpdate
unnecessary re-rendering. or PureComponent to prevent
Implement code splitting and lazy loading to load components only
when needed.
Use memoization techniques such as useMemo and useCallback to
avoid expensive computations or unnecessary re-renders.
Implement server-side rendering (SSR) to improve the initial load
time and SEO.
Optimize the size of the bundled JavaScript and CSS files using
techniques like minification and compression.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the different lifecycle methods in React? (repeated)
React has several lifecycle methods, including:
componentDidMount: Called after the component has been
mounted to the DOM.
componentDidUpdate: Called after the component has been
updated and re-rendered.
componentWillUnmount: Called just before the component is
unmounted and destroyed.
shouldComponentUpdate: Allows optimization by determining
whether the component should re-render or not.
render: Renders the component's JSX or other React components.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the "dangerouslySetState" method in
React? (repeated)
The dangerouslySetState method is used to update the state of a
React component. It is called directly on the component instance
and bypasses the usual state update mechanism provided by
setState. The use of "dangerouslySetState" is discouraged and should
be avoided in most cases.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explain the concept of prop drilling in React. (repeated)
Prop drilling refers to the process of passing props through multiple
layers of components in order to reach a deeply nested component
that needs access to the data. It can make the code more complex
and lead to less maintainable code. Context API or Redux can be
used to avoid prop drilling.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the purpose of the React Developer Tools extension? (repeated)
The React Developer Tools extension is a browser extension that
allows developers to inspect and debug React components. It
provides a panel that displays the component hierarchy, props, state,
and other useful information for React applications.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How does React handle lists and keys? (repeated)
When rendering lists in React, each item in the list should have a
unique "key" prop assigned to it. The "key" prop helps React identify
which items have changed, been added, or been removed. Keys
improve the efficiency of list rendering and help maintain
component state correctly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the role of the "defaultProps" property in React
components? (repeated)
The "defaultProps" property is used to define default values for props
in a React component. If a prop is not provided when the
component is used, the default value specified in defaultProps will
be used instead.
